        <h1>Terms</h1>
        <p>
          Last Updated: June 23, 2024
        </p>
        <p>
          These terms of service ("Terms") govern the relationship between Lua Software, doing business as foxgirl.dev ("Developer", "I", "me", or "my") and the clients ("Client", "you", or "your") engaging the Developer's services. By commissioning or contracting the Developer for software development services, you agree to be bound by these Terms.
        </p>
        <h2>Scope of Work</h2>
        <p>
          The scope of work will be defined and agreed upon between the Developer and the Client before commencement of any project. This includes the project’s requirements, timeline, and pricing/payment. I will work with you to figure out exactly what you need and how to build it.
        </p>
        <h2>Payment</h2>
        <p>
          Payment terms will be agreed upon before starting any work. Pricing will be based on the scope of work and any additional features or revisions requested by the Client. Payment will be processed via an invoice after the completion of the project.
        </p>
        <h2>Client Responsibilities</h2>
        <p>
          The Client agrees to provide timely and accurate information and materials necessary for the Developer to complete the project effectively. This includes specifications, design assets, and any other relevant resources.
        </p>
        <h2>Modifications and Revisions</h2>
        <p>
          Minor revisions and bug fixes will be addressed at no additional cost within a reasonable timeframe after delivery. Significant modifications or new features/updates requested after project completion will require a new agreement outlining the scope, timeline, and cost of the additional work. The Developer reserves the right to assess whether a requested change constitutes a minor revision or a significant modification.
        </p>
        <h2>Termination and Refunds</h2>
        <p>
          Either party may terminate the project by providing written notice. The Developer reserves the right to terminate for any reason, particularly in case of the Client’s breach of these Terms. If the project is not yet completed and payment has been processed, a full refund will be issued.
        </p>
        <h2>Intellectual Property</h2>
        <p>
          Upon receipt of full payment, the Developer grants the Client an exclusive, royalty-free license to use the delivered software for its intended purpose, including both personal and commercial use. the Developer retains the right to reuse any non-proprietary code or components developed for the Client's project.
        </p>
        <h2>Limitation of Liability</h2>
        <p>
          To the maximum extent permitted by law, the Developer shall not be liable for any indirect, incidental, special, consequential, or punitive damages, or any loss of profits or revenues, whether incurred directly or indirectly, or any loss of data, use, goodwill, or other intangible losses, arising out of or in connection with the services provided or these Terms, even if the Developer has been advised of the possibility of such damages.
        </p>
        <p>
          The Developer's total liability arising out of or in connection with these Terms or the services provided, whether in contract, tort (including negligence), or otherwise, shall not exceed the total amount paid by the Client to the Developer for the specific project giving rise to the liability.
        </p>
        <h2>Governing Law</h2>
        <p>
          These Terms shall be governed by and construed in accordance with the laws of British Columbia, Canada, where Lua Software is registered.
